## ðŸš€ Quick Start

## Project Description

In this project (completed in September 2023), I developed a computer vision pipeline to detect lane lines on the road in images and videos. The pipeline uses classical computer vision techniques to identify and draw lane lines, providing a foundation for more advanced lane detection systems used in autonomous vehicles.



## Goals and Steps

The main objectives and steps of the project are:

1. **Build a lane detection pipeline**:
   - Process individual images through multiple computer vision stages
   - Convert the image processing pipeline to handle video streams
   - Ensure real-time processing capabilities
2. **Improve the pipeline**:
   - Implement sophisticated line averaging and extrapolation
   - Create smooth, continuous lane line visualization
   - Build robustness against varying road conditions
3. **Analyze and document the results**:
   - Evaluate performance across different scenarios
   - Document limitations and potential improvements

## Reflection

### 1. Pipeline Description

My pipeline implements a series of carefully tuned computer vision algorithms:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Grayscale conversion to simplify processing
   - Gaussian smoothing (kernel size 5) to reduce image noise while preserving edges
   - Color masking to isolate white and yellow lane markings

2. **Edge Detection**:
   - Canny edge detection with optimized thresholds (low=50, high=150)
   - Gradient-based edge detection to identify sharp intensity changes

3. **Region of Interest Selection**:
   - Trapezoid mask focusing on the relevant road area
   - Dynamic vertex calculation based on image dimensions
   - Removes noise from surroundings and horizon

4. **Hough Transform**:
   - Parameterized line detection (rho=2, theta=1Â°, threshold=15)
   - Filters short line segments to reduce noise
   - Groups similar lines for robust detection

5. **Lane Line Processing**:
   - Separates lines by slope (positive/negative) for left/right lanes
   - Weighted averaging based on line segment length
   - Linear regression for smooth line fitting

6. **Visualization**:
   - Semi-transparent overlay for clear visualization
   - Consistent color coding (red for detected lines)
   - Original image preserved for context

### Pipeline Demo
The `draw_lines()` function implements a sophisticated averaging algorithm:
- Categorizes line segments by slope and position
- Applies weighted averaging based on segment length
- Uses linear regression for smooth extrapolation
- Implements temporal smoothing for video processing

### 2. Potential Shortcomings

The current implementation has several limitations:

1. **Environmental Challenges**:
   - Poor performance in adverse weather (rain, snow, fog)
   - Sensitivity to shadows and sudden lighting changes
   - Struggles with glare and night conditions

2. **Road Geometry**:
   - Limited performance on sharp curves
   - Assumes constant road width
   - May fail on steep hills affecting perspective

3. **Infrastructure Variations**:
   - Confusion at intersections
   - Problems with construction zones
   - Difficulty with worn or unclear lane markings

4. **Processing Limitations**:
   - Fixed region of interest may not adapt to all scenarios
   - No memory of previous frames in video processing
   - Potential performance impact on real-time processing

### 3. Possible Improvements

Several enhancements could address these limitations:

1. **Advanced Computer Vision**:
   - Implement RANSAC for robust line fitting
   - Use HSV color space for better color isolation
   - Add perspective transformation for bird's-eye view

2. **Robust Processing**:
   - Implement frame-to-frame tracking
   - Add Kalman filtering for smooth predictions
   - Develop adaptive thresholding for varying conditions

3. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Train CNN for lane feature extraction
   - Implement semantic segmentation
   - Use transfer learning from established models

4. **System Improvements**:
   - GPU acceleration for real-time processing
   - Multi-threading for parallel processing
   - Implement failure detection and recovery

These improvements would make the system more robust and suitable for real-world autonomous driving applications.
